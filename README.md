# VBS SQF Language

This is a modification to [Armitxes's SQF Language](https://github.com/Armitxes/VSCode_SQF) extension for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

It has been modified to use the commands for Bohemia Interactive's [Virtual Battlespace](https://bisimulations.com/virtual-battlespace-3), rather than ArmA.
